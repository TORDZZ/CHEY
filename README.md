**──★ ˙🍓 ̟  NOTE !!**

*I am a user who needs tonetags (/j, /srs, etc.) as it helps me understand tone through text! I also tend to block/hide people a lot. Sometimes it's for serious reasons, and sometimes it's because I can't see well and somebody's in the way.*

*I can also get pretty upset/overwhelmed easily, especially in big crowds. If I'm hiding behind a bush, or off to the side by myself, you know why.*
